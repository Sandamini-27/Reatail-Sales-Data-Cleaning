* Data Cleaning

The data set chosen was about the retail market of North America. It is known that the retail dynamics change over time in any country. The original data set was in Excel format (.xlsx) with 10,000 rows and 46 columns. This data set was of a manufacturing and wholesaling business of home goods and groceries. 

When going through the column names, there were columns relating to various stakeholders of this wholesaling and manufacturing business. Columns relating to customers, vendors, products, warehouses, and orders were present in the dataset. When checking the rows of the data set, it was noticed that there were some blank cells, some cells with the name error, and some with question marks. Also it was noticed that all VENDOR_NAMES that had a “?” had zero as the vendor number so these zeros were replaced with a “?”. 

The data from late 2017 up to 2020 was included in this dataset. Jupyter Notebook was used to clean the dataset using Python and to convert the cleaned dataframe to CSV format for future analysis.
